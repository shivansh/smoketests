# Smoke tests generated for base utilities (FreeBSD)

A (work-in-progress) collection of tests generated via [shivrai/smoketestsuite](https://github.com/shivrai/smoketestsuite) during [Google Summer of Code '17 with FreeBSD](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6426676740227072).

The purpose for adding these tests is to identify new cases and possible scope for improvement in test generation.
